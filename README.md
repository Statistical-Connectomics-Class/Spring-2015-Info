[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/intro](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/intro?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## stuff that would be useful to know

  * some math/stat: graph theory, basic stats & prob, optimization theory, linear algebra
  * some neurobiology
  * some numerical programming language
  * git & github
  * how to make technical presentations

## weekly presentations

  * each week we will read 2 articles, one from neuro, one from graph-stats
  * one person will present each article
  * that person will create a new repo in the https://github.com/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/
  * that repo will contain the article, other background reading, and the presentation
  * i recommend latex beamer or keynote, you are free to make presentations however you like, including chalk talks
  * these presentations are for you: reading papers, understanding them, and giving talks are all really important parts of doing science, so it is important to practice and get feedback.

## homework

  * homework will be asking >2 questions of the presenter before the *next* presentation
  * each question will be an 'issue' in the corresponding github repo
  * presenter has to address each question within a week of the due date of the question by responding to issues
  * these issues and responses will be counted up.  the fraction you do in time counts for 50% of your grade.
  * these assignments are for you: thinking about the content even after it is presented can help consolidate the information in your head, it also gives you an opportunity to provide feedback to your classmates on what was clear, and what was not, so they can improve the presentation

## course project
  
  * there will be a course project due the last day possible,
  * you will again make a github repo
  * you will implement some statistical graph method to answer some neuroscientific problem
  * the grading system will be: i will pull the repo, follow and necessary install instructions, and type 'make', or some such.  if code runs, figures are generated, and report is complied, you get an A for the project, which will be 50% of your grade. i recommend having your friends check before handing it in. 

## TA

  *  i want one, if you are auditing the class, and want money, and are willing to do a trivial amount of work, let me know.
